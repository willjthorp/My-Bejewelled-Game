## absOrb

absOrb is a single player browser based game built by Will J Thorp for a first project at the Ironhack coding school. The objective is to switch two adjacent orbs to create a match of three or more of the same colour in a horizontal or vertical line. You have to score as many points as you can within the alloted moves or time limit.

### Game features

 - Level system with three levels which you have to pass a certain score limit to pass on to the next level. Previous levels can be accessed in the main menu to go back and try to beat your highscore, which is also recorded in the menu.
 
 - Custom game creator where you can create your own game with options for board size, game mode and colours of orbs.
 
 - Special 'Power Orb' power ups, gained by matching a row of five of the same colour. These will destroy any of the same colour they get switched with that are currently on the board.
 
 - Shuffle board button if there are no possible moves available.
 
 - Background music with toggle on/off button, as well as sounds effects set in the same pitch as the music for added effect.
